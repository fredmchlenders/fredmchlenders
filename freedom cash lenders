Borrowers need enough time to repay and payments that take up a small share of their paycheck. And each payment should pay down principal, with the costs spread evenly over the loan to minimize the lender’s incentive to encourage repeated borrowing. Also, critically, the interest rate, monthly fees, and total cost of the loan must be limited and disclosed fully. For example, in Virginia, a lender can charge a maximum interest rate of 36% and a maximum maintenance fee of 8% of the original loan amount, not to exceed $25 a month—and the total loan costs are capped at half the principal or 60% for larger loans.
